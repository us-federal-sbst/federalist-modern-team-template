summary: How can OES support your evidence-based policy making needs?
---

In response to the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Making Act of 2018, OES is expanding our government-wide resources, trainings and evaluation services. These efforts will provide broader support  to agencies developing priority impact evaluations and evidence-building activities. OES will support agencies design and implement additional impact evaluations on a reimbursable basis starting in FY21.

Responding to the growing need for evaluation support, OES will work with agency partners to design and implement a broad range of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/terminology-detail/#impact-evaluations">impact evaluations</a> starting in FY21. OES will continue to work with agencies to evaluate the application of behavioral insights to improve government and work with agencies to share leading practices, resources, and build the skills of civil servants to continue this work.

### OES has experience designing rigorous impact evaluations.
Here are some examples:
- Are incentives cost-effective at reducing non response in the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/1901-ahs-incentives-nrb/">American Housing Survey</a>? 
- What is the impact of <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/soar/">Project SOAR</a> on higher educational attainment among HUD-assisted youth? 
- Can improvements in notices increase participation in the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/ticket-to-work/">Ticket to Work</a> program? 

## Collaborations on Evaluation Design
OES is working with a limited number of agency partners in FY21 and FY22 to design impact evaluations that leverage administrative data and help to answer priority learning questions. 

### Evaluation design
OES will support agencies to design priority evaluations. OES will: 
- Partner with a Federal agency to refine evaluation goal and question 
- Develop Theory of Change for program or policy 
- Identify and refine priority outcomes, with focus on administrative data 
- Propose evaluation method, mapped to question, learning objective and policy goals
- **Deliverable:** Evaluation design report

### How does OES engage with agencies to design evaluations?
OES aims to conduct evaluation design projects over an approximately 3-month sprint from initial project scoping to delivering an evaluation design report. OES can work on a limited number of designs in FY21 and FY22 on a non-reimbursable basis for projects that support government-wide learning and evidence building. OES and agency partners can collaborate on multiple evaluation designs over a longer time period with a reimbursable Interagency Agreement to develop a portfolio of evaluations.

## Evaluation Implementation 
OES implements rigorous impact evaluations on topics of government-wide relevance and key agencies priorities. OES has deep expertise utilizing existing administrative data to answer key agency questions. On a reimbursable basis, OES will:  
- Implement and oversee impact evaluation
- Refine and commit to an analysis plan 
- Conduct internal code review 
- Analyze results, with internal reanalysis, using administrative data  
- Measure impact 
- **Deliverable:** Policy brief and evaluation report
