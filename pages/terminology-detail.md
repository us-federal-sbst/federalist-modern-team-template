## Behavioral insights
The behavioral insights  approach uses evidence-based evaluations to try and understand how people make decisions. The approach utilizes applications from multiple disciplines including cognitive sciences like psychology, and social sciences like economics. Light-touch behavioral interventions—including simplification, personalization, and social norm comparison—have become increasingly  common in the academic literature and government programs. Behavioral insights can help turn evaluations into concrete recommendations.

## Evidence
Evidence can be defined as anything brought forth that supports a claim. Most evidence used in evidence-based policymaking is empirical evidence, which is evidence that is observed by the senses and documented. OES ensures that the evidence we generate is as reliable as possible by being transparent about methods and results, as well as making sure analyses can be replicated by analysts who don’t previously know the results.

## Evidence-building
Evidence building is the process of putting together evidence that can be used to support making decisions and evidence-based policymaking. The federal government engages in a wide range of evidence-building activities such as the collection, compilation, processing, analysis, and dissemination of data. The Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 elevated these activities across many agencies in the federal government.

## Randomized evaluations
A randomized evaluation is a type of evaluation where the intervention group being observed is randomly assigned as opposed to the evaluator having control over who or what is put in the intervention group. This allows for the evaluation to be tested for the intervention as opposed to other factors that may have contributed to the results had the evaluation not been randomized.

## Embed evaluations
Embedded evaluations are evaluations that take place within normal day to day activities as opposed to a separate evaluation. As OES seeks to embed evaluations into ongoing operations, the usage of administrative data to measure the effect of a program change helps save time and resources.

## Program improvements
The end goal of OES evaluations is to better government programs in how they are run, how efficient they are, and how well they accomplish their intended purposes. Evaluation results lead to program improvements across the federal government.
